        <p style="width: 50%; background-color: white; margin-left: 25%; border: solid gray; padding: 5px; border-radius: 8px">howdy, gamers! I'm a cool boy from idiot street in loserville. My hobbies include playing on my Wii U, putting my older bro's 2DS into the microwave, and overall being rad. You may find me playing starfall using McDonald's wifi, but only because I lost a bet DDDDDD: so anyways my plans for the future are going to college to get a degree in being cool and smart and in epic gaming. i don't want to end up like those hobos that i live with that just tell me to do chores all day long. if I ended up like them, i'd never be successful because i'd have no ffriends. My favorite foods are mac n' cheese, ice cream, candy, pancake mix, and my favorite soda is baking soda. </p>
